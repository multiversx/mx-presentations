# Getting Started

## Install react-native libraries
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

## iOS Pods
   If you don't have cocoapods run
   ```bash
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   ```
   After that, install pods with
   ```bash
   cd ios && pod install
   ```

## Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run your React Native App. :partying_face:

## Testing the app

1. To run tests
```bash
yarn test
```

2. To run tests in watch mode
```bash
yarn test:watch
```

3. To run tests coverage
```bash
yarn test:cov
```
